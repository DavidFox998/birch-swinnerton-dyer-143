  # Towers.BSD.MordellWeil

  BSD Tower — Mordell-Weil and BSD rank conjecture surfaces.

  Genuine named OPEN surfaces (no vacuous stubs).  All statements are
  anchored to opaque constants from B01_EllipticCurve so they cannot be
  discharged by `trivial`, `fun _ => trivial`, or `sorry`.

  Content:
  • `MordellWeil_OPEN`   — BSD rank conjecture: rank E(ℚ) = ord_{s=1} L(E,s)
                           for ALL Weierstrass curves over ℚ.
  • `IsLFunctionOf`      — genuine predicate: f is THE L-function of E
                           (pinned to the opaque EllipticLFunction anchor).
  • `BSD_rank_statement` — equivalent formulation via IsLFunctionOf.

  Mathematical gaps:
  1. `MWRank (E : WeierstrassCurve ℚ) : ℕ` — Mordell-Weil rank; the
     theorem that E(ℚ) is finitely generated is absent from Mathlib v4.12.0.
  2. `EllipticLFunction (E : WeierstrassCurve ℚ) : ℂ → ℂ` — the Hecke
     L-function L(E, s); analytic continuation requires modular-forms API
     absent from Mathlib v4.12.0.
  3. `VanishingOrder (f : ℂ → ℂ) (s : ℂ) : ℕ` — order of vanishing;
     not in Mathlib v4.12.0 for general analytic functions.

  STATUS: OPEN surfaces, NOT bricks. SORRY: 0.
  Axiom footprint: classical trio {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}.

/-- **OPEN — Mordell-Weil / BSD rank conjecture** (universal form).

    For every elliptic curve E over ℚ, the Mordell-Weil rank of E(ℚ)
    equals the order of vanishing of L(E, s) at s = 1.

    This is the rank part of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture
    (Clay Millennium Problem).  It implies in particular:
    - rank E(ℚ) = 0  ↔  L(E, 1) ≠ 0
    - rank E(ℚ) = 1  ↔  L(E, 1) = 0  and  L′(E, 1) ≠ 0

    Anchored to opaque constants `MWRank` and `EllipticLFunction` from
    B01_EllipticCurve so it CANNOT be discharged vacuously.

    Mathlib gap: both `MWRank` and the analytic `EllipticLFunction` are
    absent from Mathlib v4.12.0.

    DO NOT discharge with `trivial`, `fun _ => trivial`, or `sorry`.
    BSD stays OPEN. -/

/-- Genuine predicate: `f` is the L-function of `E`.

    Pinned to the specific opaque constant `EllipticLFunction E` from
    B01_EllipticCurve, so `IsLFunctionOf E f` cannot be satisfied by an
    arbitrary function (unlike the previous `True` stub).

    Any two functions satisfying `IsLFunctionOf E ·` are equal to each
    other (propositional uniqueness follows from transitivity). -/
def IsLFunctionOf (E : WeierstrassCurve ℚ) (f : ℂ → ℂ) : Prop :=
  f = _root_.Towers.BSD.EllipticLFunction E

/-- BSD rank statement via `IsLFunctionOf` (equivalent to `MordellWeil_OPEN`).

    Anchored: `IsLFunctionOf E L` forces `L = EllipticLFunction E`, so
    the conclusion `MWRank E = VanishingOrder L 1` is the real BSD claim.

    Named separately to make the `IsLFunctionOf` interface explicit for
    future formalization that constructs L from the Euler product. -/
